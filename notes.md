1. Idea conceived
2. Idea = collect corresponding author(s) email(s) from papers across fields, and send them an email. Check whether they bounce, or conceive some other form of automated reply as criterium for no longer in use.
3. Separate the authors' email addreses per year, and see whether there is an increase in bounces over the years.
4. Note that one email might be prevalent across multiple years, such that i would have to think about how to handle it by sending only one email and incorporating that result across the data.
5. this would be a authors x years matrix
6. as such, if same author email is in e.g., 2006 and 2010, note both as bounced if it bounced.
7. odds would be computed per year
8. and these would be plottable.

1. met with it-department, suggested using swaks to probe emails instead of actually delivering message to inbox.
